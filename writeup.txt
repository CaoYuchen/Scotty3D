CMU CG 15662 Assignment 2.0

Checking point:
I implemented erase_vertex(), erase_edge(), flip_edge(), split_edge(), collapse_edge(), bevel_face(), bevel_face_positions() functions.

erase_vertex(): key point is to go through every edges, halfedges and faces that connect the deleted vertex, map all those faces
to a single face, and to track every edge in a loop connect this vertex, only keep those edge not directly connects vertex and delete
those directly connected edges and halfedges, finally adjust the halfedge's next().

erase_edge(): find two vertices that connect this edge, change their halfedges, and also change the haledges whose next() is deleted halfedge
to it's twin's next().

split_edge(): only apply to edge that belongs to triangular, not working in more than 3 edges.
